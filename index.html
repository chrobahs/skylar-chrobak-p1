    <p>Samhain is the basis of Trick or Treating, when children would
    dress up in scary outfits to ward off any bad spirits. As seen in
    the picture, there are many bonfires with the same purpose, as well
    as the bonfire, the Jack O' Latern was created but Celtics used
    Turnips, carved the faces and would put a small candle inside</p>
